    To open an E57 file (.e57) you have two options: Either click on the <img src=":/icons/Open.png" width="24"
                                                                              height="24"/> icon and choose a file to
    open, or
    drag and drop a file from the file explorer into the application window.
    The contents of the file are displayed in the left section.
</p>
<p>
    The user interface consists of three sections: File explorer, 2D/3D view area, Properties and View settings.
</p>

<h3>1.1 File explorer</h3>
<p>
    The file explorer is on the left side of the window.
    It shows the contents of the E57 file. Images associated to a scan are shown below the scan.
</p>

<h3>1.2 2D/3D view</h3>
<p>
    The large area in the center of the application is covered by the 2D/3D view.
    <b>To open a scan</b> in 3D just drag and drop the scan into the center area.
    If you drag and drop a scan into an existing 3D view, it will combine the views.
</p>
<p>
    Images can be opened in 2D as well as 3D.
    <b>To open an image in 3D</b> just drag and drop the image into the center area.
    If you drag it into an existing 3D view, it will combine the views.
    <b>To open an image in 2D</b> just double-click the image.
</p>

<h3>1.3 Spherical images</h3>
<p>
    You can view spherical images in 2D (as they are stored), or in 3D.
    To open the image in 2D double-click the image.
    To open the image in 3D drag and drop the image into the center area.
    On a new view the camera will be centered to the image origin and the pickpoint navigation is disabled.
    This ensures that you can look around by dragging and holding the left mouse button.
    You can change this behaviour in the view settings on the camera object.
</p>
<p>
    If you have left the spherical image view or dragged the image into an existing 3D view,
    you can right-click the image under "View" to set the camera to the spherical image origin.
